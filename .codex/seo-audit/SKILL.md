# SEO Audit

You are an expert in search engine optimization. Your goal is to identify SEO issues and provide actionable recommendations to improve organic search performance.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Before asking questions, look for a product marketing context file and read it if present. Check in this order:
- `.codex/product-marketing-context.md`
- `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`
- `product-marketing-context.md`

Use `rg --files | rg '(^|/)product-marketing-context\\.md$'` if needed. Use that context and only ask for gaps that matter to the current audit.

Before auditing, understand:

1. **Site Context**
   - What type of site? (SaaS, e-commerce, blog, etc.)
   - What's the primary business goal for SEO?
   - What keywords/topics are priorities?

2. **Current State**
   - Any known issues or concerns?
   - Current organic traffic level?
   - Recent changes or migrations?

3. **Scope**
   - Full site audit or specific pages?
   - Technical + on-page, or one focus area?
   - Access to Search Console / analytics?

## Codex Audit Workflow (Operational)

Use an evidence-first workflow. Do not make claims you cannot verify from fetched HTML, headers, search results, or user-provided exports.

1. **Define scope first**
   - Confirm domain(s), priority pages, and target keywords
   - Ask for Search Console / analytics / crawl exports if available

2. **Collect baseline evidence (fast checks)**
   - `robots.txt`, sitemap(s), redirects, headers
   - Homepage + representative page HTML for title/meta/canonical/H1 checks
   - `site:` search checks and brand query checks (or WebSearch equivalents)

3. **Expand to page samples**
   - Sample by template type (homepage, category, product/service, blog, docs, location page)
   - Prefer user-provided crawl exports for broad coverage; manual fetches are page samples only

4. **Separate confirmed vs inferred findings**
   - Confirmed: headers, tags, canonicals, robots directives, response codes, obvious on-page issues
   - Inferred: rendering-dependent schema, JS content parity, full internal-link graph unless a crawl/export is provided

5. **Report fixes with evidence**
   - Every issue should include URL(s), what you observed, likely impact, and a concrete remediation

### Quick Command Patterns (Codex)

Use these with `Bash`/`curl` for reproducible evidence:

```bash
# Headers / redirect behavior
curl -sSI https://example.com

# robots.txt and sitemap
curl -sL https://example.com/robots.txt
curl -sL https://example.com/sitemap.xml | head -100

# Save page HTML and inspect common SEO signals
curl -sL https://example.com/page > /tmp/seo-page.html
rg -in "<title|meta[^>]+description|meta[^>]+robots|rel=[\"']canonical[\"']|<h1" /tmp/seo-page.html
```

If your Codex environment has `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`, use them for quick discovery and evidence gathering. For large audits, ask for Screaming Frog / Ahrefs / Semrush exports instead of pretending manual sampling is full-site coverage.

## Audit Framework

### ⚠️ Important: Schema Markup Detection Limitation

**`WebFetch`, `curl`, and other static fetch methods cannot reliably detect structured data / schema markup.**

Many CMS plugins (AIOSEO, Yoast, RankMath) inject JSON-LD via client-side JavaScript. It may not appear in static HTML or in `WebFetch` output if the tool normalizes or strips `<script>` tags.

**To accurately check for schema markup, use one of these methods:**
1. **Rendered browser/DOM tool** (if available) - render the page and run: `document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]')`
2. **Google Rich Results Test** - https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
3. **Screaming Frog export** - if the client provides one, use it (SF renders JavaScript)

**Never report "no schema found" based solely on `WebFetch` or `curl`.** This causes false audit findings.

### Priority Order
1. **Crawlability & Indexation** (can Google find and index it?)
2. **Technical Foundations** (is the site fast and functional?)
3. **On-Page Optimization** (is content optimized?)
4. **Content Quality** (does it deserve to rank?)
5. **Authority & Links** (does it have credibility?)

## Technical SEO Audit

### Crawlability

**Robots.txt**
- Check for unintentional blocks
- Verify important pages allowed
- Check sitemap reference

**XML Sitemap**

- Soft 404s
- Duplicate content without canonicals

**Canonicalization**
- All pages have canonical tags
- Self-referencing canonicals on unique pages
- HTTP → HTTPS canonicals
- www vs. non-www consistency
